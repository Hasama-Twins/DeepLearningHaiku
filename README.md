# Haiku Generator from Photo
by Summer and Evelyn Hasama
## Abstract

Generate a haiku (a Japanese 5-7-5 syllable poem often relating to nature) using deep learning. To make things a bit more interesting, take a photo as input and use an existing object detection model to determine keywords. We would then put these keywords in our haiku text generating model. Evaluate the model using BLEU or GRUEN and MOS subjective test.
