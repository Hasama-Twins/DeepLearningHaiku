## Abstract

Generate a haiku (a Japanese 5-7-5 syllable poem often relating to nature) using deep learning. To make things a bit more interesting, take a photo as input and use an existing object detection model to determine keywords. We would then put these keywords in our haiku text generating model based on GPT2. Evaluate the generated haikus using BERTScore.

## How to run the code

1. Open the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10c8s3OMpfmYegwXHPN35EXQsFH6s_AsS?usp=sharing)
2. Run all cells
